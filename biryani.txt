1. **Prepare the basmati rice**: Rinse the rice in a fine mesh sieve until the water runs clear.

Add the rice and stir gently. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the water is absorbed. 3. **Prepare the chicken**: In a separate saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.

Grind into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar. 7. **Assemble the biryani**: In a large saucepan, create a layer of cooked basmati rice. Add a layer of chicken mixture on top, followed by a sprinkle of biryani masala. Repeat this process until all ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of rice on top. 8. **Mix in the yogurt sauce**: Mix the yogurt with lemon juice and salt to taste. Spread this mixture evenly over the top layer of rice. 9. **Cover and steam**: Cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and place it over low heat. Steam for 5-10 minutes or until the flavors are well combined and the biryani is hot and fragrant. 10. **Serve**: Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves and lemon wedges.
